look in "rpm" folder for information on how to build an rpm package of zuluCrypt.

look in "debian" or "debian_package_info" folder for information on how to build a debian package.

below instructions are for those who want to build from source old school style :-)

This tool depends on the following packages installed to build, their precise name may differ in your distro.

1. libpwquality-devel( optional dependency used to check the quality of passwords when creating volumes )
2. libblkid-devel
3. libqt4-devel( required if building GUI components )
   libqt4-network
   libqtcore4
   libqtgui4
4. gcc
5. gcc-c++
6. cryptsetup-devel
7. cmake
8.
9. libgcrypt-devel
10.libsecret-devel( optional dependency to store keys in gnome's libsecret )
11.kde-devel( optional dependency to store keys in kde's kwallet )
12.pkg-config
13.libdevmapper-devel aka device-mapper-devel.
14.uuid-devel

The precise names of the above packages in debian are:

1. libpwquality-dev( optional dependency used to check the quality of passwords when creating volumes )
2. libblkid-dev
3. libqt4-dev( optional dependency used when building GUI components )
   libqt4-network
   libqtcore4
   libqtgui4
4. gcc
5. g++
6. libcryptsetup-dev
7. cmake
8.
9. libgcrypt11-dev
10.libsecret-1-dev( optional dependency used to store and retrieve volume keys using gnome's libsecret )
11.not sure of the package name( optional dependency used to store and retrieve volume keys using kde's kwallet )
12.pkg-config
13.libdevmapper-dev
14.uuid-dev
15.libudev-dev
16.chrpath
17.bzip2
18.debhelper

The project is made up of two components,the command line "pure C" based backend components and GUI Qt/C++ based front end components.

After you have above packages installed,run these 5 command to build and install.
The last command depends on your distribution,go with the one recommended by disto.

To build zuluCrypt with default options,run these 5 commands from inside the zuluCrypt source folder.

*****************************************************************************************************

mkdir build

cd build

cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DSHARE_MOUNT_PREFIX=default -DUDEVSUPPORT=true -DNOGUI=false -DQT5=false -DHOMEMOUNTPREFIX=false -DREUSEMOUNTPOINT=false -DNOGNOME=false -DNOKDE=false -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE . ..

make

make install( or sudo make install )

*****************************************************************************************************

After you have it installed,run "zuluCrypt-test" to make sure everything is working as expected.

The build system now uses GNUInstallDirs (https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.5/module/GNUInstallDirs.html), so pretty much all directories can be controlled properly.

meaning of different options:

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/
This option tells the build process to install project's files in "/usr/".

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib
This option specifies the base directory where libraries should be installed. Normally, this is automatically detected.

-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE
This option tells the build process to build the project in release mode.This mode is most suitable for non developers.

-DUDEVSUPPORT=true
This option tell zuluCrypt to ask for udev's opinion when deciding if a volume is system or not.Section 7 of the
FAQ has more information about udev's problem.Set the option to "false" to ignore udev's opinion.

The FAQ is located at: https://github.com/mhogomchungu/zuluCrypt/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions

-DNOGUI=false
This option tells the build process to build GUI components.Set this option to "true" if you do not want GUI components.

-DQT5=false
This option tells the build process to build GUI components using Qt4.Set the option to "true" if you want to build using Qt5.

-DHOMEMOUNTPREFIX=false
This option tells zuluCrypt to create mount paths at "/run/media/private/$USER".Set this option to "true" if you want
mount points to be created in user's home directory.

-DNOGNOME=false
This option tells the build process to add gnome's libsecret secure storage of passwords.Set this option to "true" if
you do not want libsecret's support.

-DNOKDE=false
This option tells the build process to add KDE's secure storage of passwords.Set this option to "true" if you do not
want KDE wallet support.

-DSHARE_MOUNT_PREFIX=default
zuluMount has an ability to create a publicly accessible mount point in addition to the default private one and this
option controls where the public share should be created.The "default" values sets a default value of "/run/media/public".
Set this variable to another path if you want to change the default location of where share mount point should be created.

-DREUSEMOUNTPOINT=false
By default,the project demands exclusive control over the mount point path causing it to complain when it finds
the path to already be taken when mounting and to unconditionally delete it on unmount.
Set this option to "true" if you want to overide the above behavior and this ability seems useful when mounting
volumes in a directory(like home directory) and wanting folder count to remain unchanged between volumes mounts.
