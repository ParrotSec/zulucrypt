ps: copy and paste all given commands to make sure you dont mistype them.
ps: at step 5,replace "5.1.0" to zuluCrypt version you are building.
ps: these instructions assumes rpm build directory is at "~/rpmbuild".
    Modify the paths in step 5 if they are different in your distribution.


1. make sure the following packages are installed in your system. Their precise names maybe different in your
   distribution:

   a. libpwquality-devel( optional dependency used to check the quality of passwords when creating volumes )
   b. libblkid-devel
   c. libqt4-devel( required if building GUI components )
   d. gcc
   e. gcc-c++
   f. cryptsetup-devel
   g. cmake
   h.
   i. libgcrypt-devel
   j. libsecret-devel( optional dependency to store keys in gnome's libsecret )
   k. kde-devel( optional dependency to store keys in kde's kwallet )
   l. pkg-config
   m. libdevmapper-devel aka device-mapper-devel.
   n. uuid-devel
   o. rpmdevtools( this package contains programs necessary to build rpm packages )

2. make sure "tar" and "xz" commands are installed in your computer as they are needed in step 5.


3. decompress the zuluCrypt archive you downloaded(you should be able to do this from context menu
   when you right the archive on your file manager).


4. open the terminal and change directory to zuluCrypt's source folder.


5. while on zuluCrypt source folder,run the following commands to create rpm building environment

   ****************************************************************************************************************

   rpmdev-setuptree
   tar   -cf  ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/zuluCrypt-5.1.0.tar ../zuluCrypt-5.1.0
   xz    -z  ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/zuluCrypt-5.1.0.tar

   ****************************************************************************************************************


5. while on zuluCrypt source folder,run the following commad to create a zuluCrypt rpm package.

   ****************************************************************************************************************

   QA_RPATHS=$[ 0x0001|0x0010 ] rpmbuild -bb rpm/zuluCrypt.spec

   ****************************************************************************************************************

6. wait for the build to finish and look for the rpm packages in a folder located in "~/rpmbuild/RPMS/".

7. consult your distribution's documentation on how to install .rpm packages and install the ones you will find in
   step 6 above.
