The build system in use is cmake

To build make sure you have the following packages installed(packages may be named differently in your distribution):

g++
gcc
cmake
kde-devel( if you want to build KDE/KWALLET support )
qt4-devel

Build instructions are below:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix`  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ..
make
make install

To build without KDE/KWALLET support,pass "-DNOKDESUPPORT=true" as one of the arguments in the third stage above

To build without gnome/secret_service support,pass "-DNOSECRETSUPPORT=true" as one of the arguments in the third stage above
