-zulucrypt (5.0.0-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low
-  [Mhogo Mchungu]
-  * New Features
-     -- add support for creating LUKS volumes that only uses a detached header.The detached header will be created in the
-        user home directory and the volume can not be unlocked without this detached header.The detached header can be
-        reattached later on through zuluCrypt-gui->menu->Volumes->Restore Volume Header.
-     -- its now possible to create a shared mount point when unlocking a volume in zuluCrypt-gui
-     -- its now possible to unlock VeraCrypt volumes from favorite feature in zuluCrypt-gui
-     -- add complete French translation to both zuluCrypt-gui and zuluMount-gui
-     -- try to silently solve problems caused by other tools mounting zuluCrypt's encryption mapper.
-     -- add support for creating a "plain dm-crypt" volume at a "none zero offset".This type of volume is useful as a
-        "poor man's version of a hidden volume feature in TrueCrypt and VeraCrypt".Best thing about this type of hidden
-        volume is that the outer volume can be anything including an "exposed file system".Currently,only zuluMount-gui can
-        open this type of volume by clicking "options" followed by "Set Volume Offset" on the mounting dialog prompt.
